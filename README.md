# My Digital Clock in Logisim

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This repository contains the implementation of a <strong>Digital Clock</strong> using <strong>Logisim</strong>, a digital circuit design software. The project demonstrates the design of a basic digital clock, including the integration of various components such as counters, multiplexers, and clocks to manage timekeeping in binary format. The clock project was built using <strong>Logisim Evolution</strong>, a graphical tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. The project includes the necessary Logisim files, screenshots, and other related resources for a complete setup.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
To work with this project and open the Logisim files, you need to have <strong>Logisim Evolution</strong> installed. Logisim Evolution is a free software tool that allows you to create and simulate digital circuits. You can download Logisim Evolution from the official site:
</p>

</ul>

<h3>How to Open the Project</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> If you haven’t already, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Mehedi-86/My_Digital_Clock_in_Logisim.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Open Logisim Evolution:</strong> Open Logisim Evolution on your machine.</li>
  <li><strong>Open the Circuit Files:</strong> Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the Logisim files:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>mehedi_2107086.circ</strong> for the original clock design.</li>
      <li><strong>new_Mehedi_2107086.circ</strong> for the updated version.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>View Screenshots:</strong> You can also view the screenshots in the <strong>Screenshorts</strong> folder for a visual representation of the design.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>
This digital clock design is based on basic components of digital circuits such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Counters:</strong> Used to keep track of seconds, minutes, and hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiplexers:</strong> To control which value (hours, minutes, seconds) is displayed at a given time.</li>
  <li><strong>Clock:</strong> A periodic signal used to sync operations in the circuit.</li>
  <li><strong>Displays:</strong> The output values are displayed on a 7-segment display or similar visual elements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Simulate the Clock:</strong> Once you open the .circ file in Logisim Evolution, you can start the simulation by clicking the <strong>Simulate</strong> button (or pressing <code>Ctrl + R</code>).
    The clock should start running, showing the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Modify and Experiment:</strong> You can modify the circuit to add more features like alarm settings, date display, or any additional functionality. Save your changes by saving the updated .circ file.</li>
</ol>
